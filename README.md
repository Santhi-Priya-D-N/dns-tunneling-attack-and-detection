The "Simulating and Visualizing DNS Tunnelling Attack Detection" 
project aims to delve into the intricacies of DNS tunnelling attacks and their 
effective detection strategies. DNS tunnelling attacks, a covert method of 
data exfiltration, pose a significant threat to organizational security. This 
project revolves around crafting a controlled simulation environment to 
replicate DNS tunnelling attacks, closely monitoring DNS traffic, and 
implementing robust detection mechanisms. 

Key objectives include: 
    1. Simulation Environment: Creating a controlled environment to 
    mimic DNS tunnelling attacks, facilitating a deeper understanding of 
    attack patterns and behaviors. 
    2. Monitoring DNS Traffic: Analyzing DNS traffic patterns to identify 
    irregularities indicative of potential tunnelling attacks. 
    3. Detection Mechanisms: Implementing proactive detection 
    strategies to swiftly pinpoint and respond to suspected DNS 
    tunnelling activities, strengthening overall network security. 
 
By emphasizing these fundamental aspects, the project aims to fortify 
defenses against DNS tunnelling attacks by enabling proactive identification 
and response mechanisms within network traffic.
